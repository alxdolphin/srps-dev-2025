## <span id="page-10-2"></span><span id="page-10-2"></span>**Screens & Screen Elements**

Information in DonorPerfect is logically organized through its screens.

## Basic Screens

DonorPerfect allows you to capture and store all the information you need to manage your donor relationships and donations. The screens described in this section are the basic screens that your system will have. Because DonorPerfect is very customizable, you may have different screens or fields in your system.

#### *Main*

The Main screen contains information about your donors, including name, address, telephone, record type, and flags (codes that describe how a donor is associated with your organization). The information you enter on the top part of this screen is stored in the DPADD.DBF table, and the information you enter in the bottom part of this screen is stored in the DP.DBF table. Phone numbers and email addresses are stored in their own table to allow for multiple numbers and addresses.

# <span id="page-26-0"></span><span id="page-26-0"></span>**3. Personalizing DonorPerfect**

## **Overview**

If you have a DonorPerfect password, you can personalize your Welcome screen, data entry defaults, and user options. These personalizations are extensions of your password settings. The following sections in this chapter explains how to personalize DonorPerfect:

- ["Setting Up the Welcome Screen](#page-26-1)"—see page [27](#page-26-1)
- ["Setting Data Entry Default Values](#page-28-1)"—see page [29](#page-28-1)
- ["Setting User Options"](#page-30-1)—see page [31](#page-30-1)

## <span id="page-26-1"></span><span id="page-26-1"></span>**Setting Up the Welcome Screen**

The Welcome screen, which is displayed when you log into DonorPerfect or press the **Home** button , provides quick links to DonorPerfect program functions and reports and it's completely customizable. You can change the program and report links, and edit the parameters of the linked reports, directly from the Welcome screen.

## Changing the Links on the Welcome Screen

You can create your own personalized list of links on the Welcome screen—and change them whenever your needs change. For example, you might initially set up the Welcome screen to include the functions and reports you use most of the time, and then change it during a hectic event season.

- X **To change the links on the Welcome screen** 
  - 1. On the **Welcome** screen, click the **Edit List** button . The Manage Welcome Screen Content screen appears.

## <span id="page-28-1"></span><span id="page-28-1"></span>**Setting Data Entry Default Values**

In DonorPerfect, you can speed data entry by setting default values for the data entry fields on your screen. These default values are automatically entered when a new record is created and are very useful if you need to repeatedly enter the same data on a screen. For example, if the majority of your incoming gifts have a General Ledger code of **UN** and a Solicitation code of **DM07**, set these values as your defaults. You always have the option to overwrite the defaults. Because it is easy to change default values, you can even set them daily as your data entry tasks changes.

{29}------------------------------------------------

# Personalizing DonorPerfect

**Note:** If your system uses passwords, you have the option to set defaults per user; see "Entry Screen Parameters" in the *DonorPerfect Administrator's Guide* for details. This allows each user to set defaults for their own needs. If password protection is not turned on (single user version only) or the "Assign defaults per user" option is not selected in Entry Screen Parameters, changing the default values will affect all DonorPerfect users.

The default values you define are automatically completed when you create a new record. For the Main screen, you have the option to define separate defaults for individuals and organizations.

### To set default values

1. Click the **Utilities** button

![](_page_29_Picture_2.jpeg)

 and then select **Set Defaults**. The **Select a Screen** dialog box appears.
- Click the entry screen for which you want to set defaults: Main, Gift, Pledge, Other Info., Link, Contact, Bio. 2, or Addr/Sal. The **Set Defaults** screen for the entry screen you selected appears. If the Main screen is chosen, the system prompts you with a message, asking if you want to display the screen for an Individual or Organization.

1. Enter the default values in the desired fields.
2. Click **Done**.

{30}------------------------------------------------

# Setting User Options

You can define a number of preferences and options for working with DonorPerfect. You can save keystrokes by creating function keys that automatically type a phrase when press a function key. You can also save, edit, copy, or delete user-defined selection filters—and see a list of all your user-defined selection filters. In addition, you can change your own password and specify user parameters, even if you don't have access to Password Maintenance.

## Defining User-Defined Function Keys

You can save keystrokes by creating function keys that automatically type a phrase when you press a function key. You can define the following function keys: SHIFT+F1 to SHIFT+F9 and CTRL+F1 to CTRL+F9.

### To define a function key

1. Click the **Help** button

![](_page_30_Figure_10.jpeg)

 and then select **Edit Function Keys**. The **Edit Function Keys** screen appears.
- In the row that has the function key (for example, Shift-F1) you want to use, enter the phrase you want the system to type when you use the function key.
For example, if your donors live in Horsham, create a function key for the city, state, and zip code, as the following graphic illustrates.

![](_page_30_Figure_10.jpeg)

3. Click **OK**.

Version 10.0 August 2008 Page 31

{31}------------------------------------------------

#### <span id="page-31-0"></span><span id="page-31-0"></span>*Sample Function Keys*

You can define function keys in any number of ways in DonorPerfect. This section details some function key examples and explanations of each.

#### • **SHIFT+F1: Horsham; PA19044**

The semi-colon causes the TAB key to be pressed (it's not necessary to use a semicolon after PA because DonorPerfect automatically takes you to the next field when you complete the State field). To use this function key, press SHIFT+F1 when in the city field on the Main screen.

#### • **Formula functions**

To place a formula into a function key, precede the formula with &. The formula must be of a character type. Examples are:

today's date &dtoc(date()) one year from today &dtoc(date()+365) today's date + user id &dtoc(date()) + dpuser.idcode

## Saving and Managing Filters

You can save, edit, copy, or delete user-defined selection filters. In addition, you can see a list of all your user-defined selection filters.

## *Saving User-Defined Filters*

# Personalizing DonorPerfect

1. In the **Filter Name** field, enter the name with which you want to save your user-defined filter. Use a name that describes what you've included in the filter (for example, Auction Gifts).
2. If you want to restrict the filter to users in a particular group, enter the group number in the **User Group** field.
3. If you want to make the filter available to other users, click the **Shared** check box.
4. If desired, enter a **Description**. Generally, the filter name provides enough space to clearly identify the filter; however, you may want to enter a more detailed description, which is shown when you highlight a filter.
5. Click **OK**. Your selection filter is saved to the system and available for future use.

## Using a Saved Selection Filter

Once you've saved a selection filter, you can use it at any time, except in the Flexible Information Generator.

### To use a saved selection filter

1. From any report or listing selection screen, select the **Set Selection Filter** check box. The **Selection Criteria** screen appears.
2. From the filter list that appears, choose the saved filter you want to use.

![](_page_32_Figure_12.jpeg)

1. Click **OK**. The **Selection Verification Screen** appears. You may edit the filter here, but your edits will not be saved for future use. To edit your saved filter, see the following section.
2. Click **OK**.

{33}------------------------------------------------

#### *Copying, Editing, or Deleting a Saved Selection Filter*

Through the **Change User-Defined Filters** screen, you have the option to copy, edit, or delete saved selection filters. When copying or editing selection filters through this screen, you need to enter the selection filter just as you would if you were modifying it on the Selection Verification Screen.

Here are a few things to remember about editing filters:

- **Use quotes around words**. Field names never have quotes around them, but the comparison string does. Do not place quotes around numbers unless they are in a character type field such as zip code. Examples: **st = "PA"**
- **Substring Search.** The **\$** *substring search* formula syntax is *substring* \$ *field*. In English, read the **\$** as "within". For example, if searching for everyone with **BRD** within the FLAGS field, the criteria would be: **"BRD" \$ flags**
- **Variable Dates.** Place {DT1} and {DT2} in the criteria search to allow you to enter a variable date each time you use the selection filter. For example, **ls\_dt >= {dt1}** would find everyone with a last gift date greater than the date entered in the "Dt1" box at the top of the Edit Criteria screen.

## Setting User Preferences

You can change your own password and specify a number of user parameters even if you don't have access to Password Maintenance.

#### To set user preferences

1. Click the **Utilities** button

![](_page_37_Figure_6.jpeg)

 and then select **Change User Options**. The **User Options** screen appears.

1. Make changes to any of the following fields:
   - **Word Processor (CD/DB):** this sets the format of the mail merge data file that is created for letters, acknowledgements, and pledge reminders. The delimiters are **CD** (comma-delimited) or **DB** (dbase). **CD** is recommended for most word processors, including MS Word and WordPerfect. If the DB format is used, both a dBase and comma delimited file are created whenever a mail merge data file is made.
   - **Field Delimiter/Record Delimiter:** if the desired mail merge data file delimiter is neither dbase nor comma-delimited, then enter the applicable field and record delimiter; otherwise, leave these fields blank.
   - **Remove CR-Ret:** if you want to remove the carriage return at the end of the file, select this check box. If you are using MS Word, select it; if you're using WordPerfect, don't select it.

## Personalizing DonorPerfect

- **Merge File Header:** if you want the top record of the mail merge data file to include field names, select this check box. This is required for MS Word comma delimited files.
- **Merge File Extension:** this option allows you to change the extension of the mail merge data file. The default extension for mail merge data files is **.CSV** (**DONMRG.CSV**, **DONPLG.CSV** AND **TY.CSV**), unless the file type is set to dBase, in which case, it is **.DBF**. If you have the mail merge delimiter set to **DB** (dBase), the mail merge file will still have the extension of dbf. A comma delimited file is also created when the DB delimiter is used, and that file will have the extension set here.
- **Word97-Style Merges:** if you're using MS Word 97, select this check box; Word 97 requires a slightly different merge data file format than MS Word 2000. Selecting this box will prevent error messages from appearing when running mail merges. This checkbox affects the last character of the data file. When this option is checked, the data file will have a carriage return at the end (Word 97 format). This option only takes affect when the **Remove Cr-RET** check box is set to **Y**. Otherwise, a complete Carriage Return and Line Feed is placed at the end of the file.
- **Merge File Directory:** enter the directory in which the mail merge files will be placed. If blank, the data files are placed in the DonorPerfect directory.
- **Splash Screen File:** enter the full path and file name for the file that appears as this user's DonorPerfect background splash screen. Any .JPG, .BMP or .ICO file can be used.
- **Welcome Screen at Startup:** if you want the Welcome screen to be displayed at startup, select this check box. The Welcome screen contains links to DonorPerfect program functions and reports, and you can modify the links at any time to include your current favorites (see page 27). If you don't select to display the Welcome screen at startup, you can always access it by clicking the Home button.

- **Size Splits for Financial Reports:** The Income Analysis Report groups the total gift counts and amount by the size splits you enter here. In fields **1-9**, enter each dollar amount you want the Income Analysis Report to use to group gifts. 1 is the lowest dollar amount, and 9 is the highest; if you don't want to use all the fields, enter 0 in the fields you don't want to use. For more information on this report, see the *DonorPerfect Reports* manual. The following graphic shows a sample of values you can enter:

# **4. Setting Up DonorPerfect Codes**

# **Overview**

To make DonorPerfect more efficient and help ensure the consistency of your data, some of the fields you see on DonorPerfect screens are *coded*. For example, you probably use many different types of thank-you letters, and each is associated with a unique code for database processing: 01 for the Standard Thank You, 03 for the Capital Campaign Thank You, and so on. These codes are customizable. You can change the codes (and associated text) that you already have, add new ones as the need arises, and delete old ones you no longer need. The following sections explain how:

- ["Adding Codes"](#page-40-0)—see page [41](#page-40-0)
- ["Editing Codes"](#page-43-0)—see page [44](#page-43-0)
- ["Inactivating Codes](#page-44-0)"—see page [45](#page-44-0)
- ["Deleting Codes](#page-44-1)"—see page [45](#page-44-1)
- ["Sample Codes for DonorPerfect Tables](#page-44-2)"—see page [45](#page-44-2)

# <span id="page-40-0"></span><span id="page-40-0"></span>**Adding Codes**

You may need to add codes to your system for reasons such as you are sending a new mailing and need to add a new SOL code, or you've started a new committee and need to add a new FLAG that can be assigned to committee members.

![](_page_40_Picture_12.jpeg)

**Note:** All the codes that you add for a particular field (for example, SOL, GL, FLAGS) should be the same length.

 next to Field Name.
- 6. If you selected one of the following fields, complete the additional information that appears at the bottom of the screen:
  - **SOL (Solicitation Code):** the additional information is **Total Mailed**, **Printing Costs**, **Other Costs**, **Goal**, and **Date**; these fields appear on the Solicitation Analysis Report. You can auto-fill a Campaign code based on the Solicitation code. To do this, enter the Campaign code in the **Auto-Fill Campaign** field.

{42}------------------------------------------------

- **GL (General Ledger):** the additional information allows you to enter your accounting system's code (which is often different than the one used by DonorPerfect) in the **Account Code** field. The accounting code is used in the Accounting Interface Module (see page [268\)](#page-267-0). For organizations using memberships, you can also set up the system to automatically update the membership category and expiration date for GL codes that are used for membership gifts; to do this, enter Y in the **Updates MCAT** field.
- **MCAT (Membership Category):** the additional information allows you to enter each membership level's dollar range, which is used to auto-update the MCAT field. Enter the lower and upper limits of the dollar range in the **MCAT Low \$** and **MCAT High \$** amounts for each membership category. See the *DonorPerfect Administrator's Guide* for more information regarding automatic updating of membership categories and expiration dates.
- **Link:** the additional information allows you to set the reciprocal link for this code. This sets the link so that when one name is linked to another name, the reciprocal link is automatically created. These links allow you to easily navigate between linked donors.
- **TYLETTER (Thank-you Letter):** you can automatically complete the thankyou letter number for a gift record based on the information you enter in these additional fields. To set the criteria for the automatic calculation of the thank-you number, edit the desired TYLETTER code. Click the Set Criteria button, and set the criteria. The automatic assignment of TYLETTER is finished when the acknowledgment process is run and only affects gifts with nothing entered into TYLETTER.

# Blank Codes and Descriptions

DonorPerfect allows you to enter both blank codes and blank descriptions, except for multicoded fields, such as Flags, through the Code Maintenance section. Blank fields are useful if you need to erase the contents of a field, but you're not sure what value to assign. Remember that if you leave the description blank, the description for that code will display as blank in reports or screens where descriptions are used.

{43}------------------------------------------------

# Editing Codes

As you manage your fund-raising efforts, you may need to edit or update the codes used in your system.

**Note:** Editing a code through Code Maintenance does NOT change the code in an existing record. If you want to change code values for existing records, you must perform a global replace. For more information on globally replacing codes, see the *DonorPerfect* Administrator's Guide.

# Inactivating Codes

If you are no longer using a code, and you don't want it to appear on the F2 code list, you have the option to mark it as inactive. Use this feature if you have many old codes in your system (common problem with SOL codes), and you only want to see the current ones in the code list. Inactive codes continue to appear on reports if you're using a filter that includes them. You can temporarily view inactive codes in filters or on an entry screen by selecting the **Include** Inactive? check box.

### To inactivate a code

1. Click the Utilities

![](_page_44_Picture_10.jpeg)

 button and then select **Code Maintenance**. The **Change Codes** screen appears.
- Highlight the code you want to make inactive, and double-click it or click **Edit**.
- Select the **Inactive** check box, and then click **OK**.

# Deleting Codes

You may need to periodically delete codes from your system.

**Warning!** Do not delete codes unless you have run reports or filters to be certain that no data in the system uses the codes you want to delete.

**Note:** Deleting a code through Code Maintenance does NOT delete data in existing records.

### To delete a code

1. Click the Utilities

![](_page_44_Picture_13.jpeg)

 button and then select **Code Maintenance**. The **Change Codes** screen appears.
- Highlight the code you want to remove, and click the **Delete** button. The following message appears: **Are you sure you want to delete this record?**
- Click **Yes** to confirm.
- Click **Done**.

# Sample Codes for DonorPerfect Tables

| AUXI | Auxiliary  | DECD | Deceased Donor   |

### Type of Donor

The type of donor defines what type of entity the donor is. Sample donor types are listed below. These donor types must be mutually exclusive, because the donor, like all single-value fields, can only be assigned to one type.

| INDV | Individual | COMP | Company      |
|------|------------|------|--------------|
| FOUN | Foundation | ORGN | Organization |

## Gift Table

In the Gift (DPGIFT.DBF) table, you can set up codes for general ledger, solicitation, sub-solicitation, and type of gift.

# **5. Managing Donor Information**

# **Overview**

This chapter provides instructions on how to manage the donors in your system. In order to make the most of your fund-raising efforts, you'll want to track information about your donors, their addresses, their gifts, their pledges, and your interactions with them. DonorPerfect allows you to handle each of these tasks in your system. See the following sections for more information:

- ["Searching for Donors](#page-49-0)"—see page [50](#page-49-0)

# Searching for Donors

DonorPerfect gives you an easy and quick way to locate the donors that you need to find.

#### **To search for a record**

1. Click the Search Records button

![](_page_49_Picture_6.jpeg)

 The Enter Name to Look Up screen appears.
![](_page_49_Picture_6.jpeg)

- Use one or more of the following lookup methods, and then enter the appropriate lookup criteria:

- **Last Name/ID #** is the primary field used to look up records. This field allows you to search by last name for individuals, organization name for businesses, or ID number for any type of record. You can enter the entire Last Name or Organization name or only a portion of the name. The system will locate records that match or begin with the data entered.
- You can use the pull-down next to **Last Name/ID #** to change the primary search from Last Name/ID # to one of five user-defined criteria (to set up the criteria, see "Defining Parameters" in the *DonorPerfect Administrator's Guide*). Depending on how you define these fields, they may be from the Main (DP.DBF), Address (DPADD.DBF) or Phone (DPPHONE.DBF) tables. Email addresses are stored as phone records, so searching the phone table enables an email search, as well as a phone number search. You don't need to enter the entire value, and the field is not case sensitive. If you're looking up a record by phone number, parentheses and other punctuation must be entered too. For example, **(215)555-3322** and **(215)555** are both valid entries for a phone number search; **19044** and **19** are valid entries for a zip code search.
- **First Name:** this allows you to narrow the search for specific individuals by entering a first name in addition to a last name.
- **City, State (or user-definable field):** like the First Name field, the City and State fields allow you to narrow a search. If you enter a last name of Jones and a City and State, the system locates only those records in the specified City and State with the last name of Jones. The entire field does not need to be entered, and it is not case sensitive. Examples of valid entries are: **Horsham, Horsh, PA,** or **pa.** City and State are the defaults. You may change the two fields that appear on this screen for narrowing the search (to set up these fields, see "Defining Parameters" in the *DonorPerfect Administrator's Guide*). The fields may be from the Main (DP.DBF) or Address (DPADD.DBF) databases.

Page 50 Version 10.0 August 2008

{50}------------------------------------------------

3. If you want to define a selection filter to look for donors, select the **Set Selection Filter** check box. Define the filter (you can select from either the Main or Address tables only), and click **OK** at the **Selection Verification Screen**. The filter stays in effect until the check box is no longer selected or when the entry session is closed. For details on building and setting filters, see page [118](#page-117-0).

![](_page_50_Figure_3.jpeg)

**Note:** To clear all lookup criteria, including any filters that are currently set, click the **Clear** button.

4. Click the **Lookup** button, or press **ENTER**. The donors who meet the criteria you entered are listed at the bottom of the **Enter Name to Lookup** screen.

![](_page_50_Picture_6.jpeg)

- 5. If more than 149 names were found that met the criteria and you want to see more than the first 149, click the **<click here for more records>** message at the end of the donor list. (This message only appears when more than 149 names are found.)
- 6. Double-click anywhere in the row that contains the record you want to view. The **Main Donor Entry** screen appears. For example, the following Main Donor Entry screen appears if you double-click in the first row of the search results in the illustration above.

# Maintaining Donor Information

DonorPerfect allows you to easily manage your donors and the relevant information about them. You can add, edit, and delete donors at any time.

## Adding Donors

There are two types of donors records—individual or organization. The information you need to enter for each type of donor varies. See the following sections for details.

## Adding Individual Donor Records

An individual donor is a donor who is not primarily affiliated with a company and who donates on his or her own to your organization. Individual donors may be linked to their employers, but in general, they contribute to your organization on their own and not through their companies.

![](_page_52_Figure_8.jpeg)

### To add an individual donor

1. Click the Search Records button

![](_page_52_Figure_12.jpeg)

. The Enter Name to Look Up screen appears.
- Enter the donor's last name, or just the first part of it, in the **Last Name** field, and then click the **Lookup** button.
**Note:** Although you can leave the **Last Name** field blank, entering all or part of the last name helps prevent the creation of duplicates in your database, for instance, when you get a check from one member of a household who is already in your database as a "Mr. and Mrs."

{53}------------------------------------------------

# Managing Donor InformationDonorPerfect

1. If the donor isn't on the list that appears, click the **Add Ind.** button to add the donor to your database. The **Main** screen appears. (If the donor is on the list, double-click their name to update their record.)
2. Complete the following information related to the donor's name. If you entered any of the information on the **Enter Name to Look Up** screen, it will already be filled in.

- **Last Name:** the last name of the donor. You can look up information about the person on the Internet by clicking the **Google** button

![](_page_53_Picture_8.jpeg)

.
- **Suffix:** Ph.D., MD, Jr., III, and so on; prints as part of the full name (for example, John Smith, Ph.D.).
- **First Name:** the first name of the donor.
- **Dear:** the salutation line, which is used for mailings. You may leave this field blank if you want the donor addressed in the salutation as "Title + Last Name," or customize it to address a record informally.

| <b>Note:</b> The value you enter in the Dear field determines the salutation in mailings. Dear is not included as part of the salutation—you'll need to type it in your letter. Here are some guidelines you should keep in mind: |
|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| If the Dear field has a value in it, each letter you create has the salutation of "[value in Dear field]." For example, "Roger and Mary."                                                                                         |
| If the Dear field is blank, each letter has the salutation of "Title+Last Name." For example, "Mr. Sandstone."                                                                                                                    |
| If the Dear field and the Title field are blank, each letter has the salutation of "First Name." For example, "Roger."                                                                                                            |

- **Title:** Mr., Ms., Mr. & Mrs., Dr., and so on; this prints on labels/letters as part of the full name (for example., Mr. & Mrs. John Smith).
- **Prof. Title:** the donor's professional title (for example, President, CEO). Use this field when you're sending mail to the donor's work address.

Page 54

Version 10.0  
August 2008

{54}------------------------------------------------

- **Optional Line:** this field is used to enter a secondary name or company name if sending mail to a donor's work address. The optional line entry will print above the address line on labels and envelopes
  - o For a married donor whose spouse has a different last name, enter the spouse's complete name as you want it to appear on a mailing label.
  - o For a donor's business address, use this line to identify the company.
- 5. Enter the following information for the donor's address:
  - **Address:** the donor's street address. You can look up the address on the Internet by clicking the **Map** button or the **Whitepages** button .
  - **City, ST, Zip:** these fields represent the City, State, and Zip Code information for the donor. If you want to include a hyphen as part of the zip code, you should enter it as part of the zip code. You can look up the zip code on the Internet by clicking the **Binoculars** button .
  - **Address Type:** this is used to indicate whether the address is the home, work, or other type of address for the individual. For more information on address types, see page [61.](#page-60-0)
- 6. If the donor does not want to receive mail from your organization, select the **Do Not Mail** check box. If this is selected, the record will not be included in mailing labels or merge letters, but it will still be included in thank-you letter mail merge files. You can easily override this when running mailings by selecting the **Include NO MAIL records** check box in the mail merge process (see page [61](#page-60-0) for more information).
- 7. If you've selected the **Do Not Mail** check box, you should enter the reason the donor does not want to receive mail in the **Reason** field.
- 8. The **Phone Number** pull-down or phone list box displays all phone numbers and email addresses for this record.

To add, edit, or display all numbers, click the phone icon , press CTRL+T, or double-click the list if you're using a phone list box. The Phone Type must be selected for each phone number you enter. You can enter phone numbers that are up to 40 characters, which gives you room to enter an extension or the name of the person who is attached to that number. If you wish to reorder the phone numbers, change the order number in the **Order** column; next time you view the phone list, the phone numbers will be reordered.

The **Mask** check box turns off any formatting for the number in that row. This check box is used for email addresses and non-standard numbers (for example, overseas). The DonorPerfect email functions (Mailings, Group Email, or the Send Email icon from the entry screen) identify email addresses based on all entries that have an **@** in them.

You can identify which member of a household a phone or email record belongs to. For information, see page [59.](#page-58-0)

{55}------------------------------------------------

# Managing Donor Information

# DonorPerfect

## 9. Enter the following additional information for the donor:

- **Record Type:** this is used to indicate the type of record (for example, Individual, Company, Organization, or Foundation) for this donor. A record can only have one type.
- **Flags:** this field describes how a donor is associated with your organization. A donor's Flags field can have multiple values. If you are typing codes into the Flags field, separate them with a comma and no space.
- **Spouse/Partner:** optional field for first name of donor's spouse or partner.
- **Donor Solicitor:** the person at your organization who is primarily responsible for contacting or cultivating the donor.

## 10. To enter data on other entry screens, click the desired tab.

## 11. When you're finished entering the information for the new donor, click **Done**.

- If the information you entered **does not** closely match any existing records, a new donor record is created.
- If the information you entered **does** closely match one or more existing records, the **Duplicate Donor Check** screen appears. See "Checking for Duplicate Records," below, for details on this function.

# Checking for Duplicate Records

The Duplicate Donor Check function screens the donor records you add to the system to make sure that you are not creating a duplicate of an existing record.

If the system detects that you have attempted to add a duplicate record, the Duplicate Donor Check screen appears:

![](_page_55_Figure_14.jpeg)

## Managing Donor Information

### Resolving Duplicate Records

The existing records that the system has matched to your new one are listed.

To resolve the situation, do one of the following:

- To update an existing donor record with the information that was entered in the new record, select the donor record from the list, and click the **Update Selected Donor** button. Information that was entered for the new record will overwrite the existing information for the selected record. Fields that were not filled out in the new record will be ignored.
- Click the **Create New Donor** record to create the new donor record anyway.
- Click the **Cancel** button to cancel the creation of the new record.

**Note:** To enable the Duplicate Donor Check function, check the **Check for duplicates when creating new donors?** option on the **General** tab of the Entry Screen Parameters screen. See "Defining Parameters" in the *DonorPerfect Administrator's Guide* for details.

### Adding Organization Donor Records

An organization or company donor is a donor where the contributor is the organization or company itself. These donors have individuals listed as contacts, but their contributions come from the organization and not from an individual person.

    To add, edit, or display all numbers, click the phone icon, press **CTRL+T**, or double-click the list if you're using a phone list box. The **Phone Type** must be selected for each phone number you enter. You can enter phone numbers that are up to 40 characters, which gives you room to enter an extension or the name of the person who is attached to that number. If you wish to reorder the phone numbers, change the order number in the Order column; next time you view the phone list, the phone numbers will be reordered.
    

    The **Mask** check box affects the formatting for the number in that row. If it is selected, formatting is applied; if it is not selected, formatting is removed. This check box is used for email addresses and non-standard numbers (for example, overseas). The DonorPerfect email functions (Mailings, Group Email, or the Send Email icon from the entry screen) use the email address based on all numbers that have an @ in them.
    

    You can identify which contact at an organization a phone or email record belongs to. For information, see page 59.
3. Enter the following additional information for the donor:
   - **Flags:** this field describe how a donor is associated with your organization. A donor's Flags field can have multiple values.
   - **Record Type:** this is used to indicate whether the record is Individual, Company, Organization or Foundation. A record can only have one type.
   - **Donor Solicitor:** the person at your organization who is primarily responsible for contacting or cultivating the donor organization.
4. To access any other entry screen, select the tab heading.
5. When you're finished entering the donor's information, click **Done**.
   - If the information you entered **does not** closely match any existing records, a new donor record is created.
   - If the information you entered **does** closely match one or more existing records, the **Duplicate Donor Check** screen appears. See "Checking for Duplicate Records," page 56 for details on this function.

## Assigning Names to a Phone Number

The Phone Numbers screen allows you to link an alternate name (or names) from a record's Address/Sal screen to a particular phone number. The word **\*Links** appears next to phone numbers that have names linked to them. Linking is useful in instances such as a family where the wife and husband each have their own salutation record, so that phone numbers can be linked to the right person. It can also be used with companies that have more than one contact,

{59}------------------------------------------------

# Managing Donor Information

## DonorPerfect

so each contact can be linked to their own phone number. It's also useful when you want to send a mailing to an alternate name's email address. Once a phone number has been linked to a name, it appears on the Address/Salutation screen for that record.

#### To link a phone number to a name

1. Find the record for which you want to link a phone number to a name, and open it.

## Various Types of Addresses

DonorPerfect can accommodate the needs of specific donors and the preferences of your organization by allowing flexible address options:

- Standard letter address block
- Formal address
- Informal address
- Address for couple
- Business address for individual
- Company address

The following sections show various ways to enter addresses on the **Main Entry** screen along with how each address will appear on a mailing label. The salutation for the mail merge letter is also displayed.

**Note:** If the salutation field is left blank, donors are addressed as Title + Last Name as long as there is something in the Title field. If there is nothing in the Title field, it defaults to the First Name field.

## Standard Letter Address Block

The standard letter address block on labels and in mail merges is as follows:

TITLEFNAME LNAME SUFFIX

PROFESSIONAL TITLE

OPTIONAL LINE

ADDRESS

{61}------------------------------------------------

CITY, ST ZIP

Mr. & Mrs. Roger Sandstone

2522 N. Adams Ct.

Philadelphia, PA 19115-3309

Dear Mr. & Mrs. Sandstone,

The **Dear** field is left blank, so the default of **Title + Last Name** appears as the salutation. If there is a **Spouse** field, fill it in. The Spouse field is for informational purposes only, as the spouse's name does not display in the address or salutation.

#### *Informal Address*

The following graphic shows how you would enter an informal address for a record:

# Managing Donor Information

## Maintaining Additional Addresses and Salutations

The **Address/Salutation** entry screen allows you to enter additional addresses and/or salutations for donors. From this screen, you can designate the type of mailings a specific alternative address is to receive. This allows you to send mail to a specific member of a household and still maintain the primary record as the couple, company, or family (for instance, for board, staff, or volunteer mailings).

### Adding Another Address or Salutation

If you need to add additional address or salutation, DonorPerfect allows you to easily do that.

#### To add another address or salutation

1. Find the donor record for which you want to add another address or salutation, and double-click it. The record appears.
2. Click the Addr/Sal tab. The Initial Address/Salutation Lookup screen appears.

![](_page_69_Figure_9.jpeg)

![](_page_69_Figure_10.jpeg)

   - **Alternate Address:** address is different from the primary address but the name and salutation is same as that on the Main screen.
   - **Both:** both the name and address are different than the primary entry.

A new entry is created in the next available row. Some of the fields are filled in, depending on what you selected in the previous step.

1. Double-click the row that contains the new entry.

The Address/Salutation Entry screen appears.

# Managing Donor InformationDonorPerfect

on page **Error! Bookmark not defined.**, the alternate address is for Mary Sandstone, but the main record is for Roger & Mary Sandstone. When this box is checked, and you type in Sandstone on the Lookup screen, both the Roger & Mary Sandstone and Mary Sandstone records will appear.

### Use Name from Main:

select this check box to use the name from the Main entry screen; if you select this, do not enter a name on this screen. Future edits to the main screen will carry over to this record.

### Use Address from Main Screen:

select this check box to use the address from the Main entry screen; if you select this, do not enter an address on this screen. Future edits to the main screen will carry over to this record.

### Primary Address:

if this check box is selected, this address becomes the primary address displayed on the Main entry screen. You are asked to verify that you want this address to be the primary address.

9. On the lower right side of the screen, choose the mailings you want this name/address to receive. Primary addresses are typically marked **All Others**.

 Every Mailing  
 Selected Mailcodes  
 No Mailings  
 All Others

### Every Mailing:

allows this address to receive all mail, regardless of whether the "Choose Alternate Name/Address" option is used when running the mailing. Use this to duplicate mailings to be sent to the primary address. Use this to duplicate mailings being sent to the primary address.

### Selected Mailcodes:

this option is used along with the "Choose Alternate Name/Address" option (see page [168](#page-167-0) for more information) when running mailings. Enter the specific mail code or codes that will trigger use of this address in a mailing. This code is used on the Listing and Mailings screen (see page [160](#page-169-0) for more information), to specify which to include in a mailing.

### No Mailings:

prevents this alternate address from receiving any mailings.

### All Others:

This address will be used when the "Choose Alternate Name/Address" option is selected for a mailing and no other addresses for the record have the selected mailing codes. This is the default option for all addresses and the correct selection for the primary address.

10. When you've defined how the additional address or salutation should be used, complete the following information:

### Mailing Codes:

enter mail codes (or choose them by clicking the magnifying glass ) for the specific types of mail this alternative address should receive. Mail codes must be entered if **Selected Mailcodes** is chosen for this address/salutation (see description in previous step).

**Address)** and the **Alternative Address (Seasonal Address)**. This option also allows you to use the selected mail codes function for addressing the donor differently. (For instructions on mailing to alternate addresses, see page 168.) The program will use the appropriate address for mailings and labels, but reports will consistently use the primary address.

1. To access any other entry screen, select the tab heading.
2. When you are finished entering all information, click **Done**.

#### *Example: Addressing and Mailing to One Person of a Married Couple*

When you have donors who are married, often the Main tab for their records shows the name of the couple. This can be problematic when you need to send mail to only one person in a married couple. For instance, your board member is Mary Sandstone, but the donor record is set up for Mr. and Mrs. Roger Sandstone because she donates with her husband. You can add an alternate address/salutation to solve this issue.

#### **To set up mailings and labels addressed to only one person in a couple**

1. Add a record to the **Addr/Sal** screen using the **Name/Salutation** option.
2. Enter the name and salutation for the person to whom you want to send the mailing and the mailing code used for mailings you want the person to receive (for example, "BD" for "Board Member").
3. Select the **Use Address From Main Screen** check box, and do not enter an address on this screen (it will automatically be filled in).

## **Maintaining Gift Information**

The Gift tab is used to record all donor gifts including cash, check, stock, in-kind, matching, and memorial gifts. You can also record soft credits for donors who are to be recognized for their part in generating contributions.

### **Adding Gifts**

## Linking Notifications/Memorial Gifts/Soft Credits

The **Link Name to Gift** option allows you to link another donor record to the current gift as a Soft Credit, Notification, or Matching Gift Link.

There are three types of gift links you can create:

- **Soft Credit:** use this type to recognize one donor, such as a board member or other solicitor, for the contribution of another. Choosing this type creates a transaction that appears in the giving history, marked as a Soft Credit with an asterisk. The amount does not affect the donor's giving totals unless you change how the system handles calculated fields; for more information, see "Defining Calculated Fields" in the *DonorPerfect Administrator's Guide*.
- **Send Notification:** this type allows you to generate a thank-you letter to the linked name (in addition to the donor) at Acknowledgment Processing time. For instance, a letter can be generated to the person for whom the gift was in tribute. Choosing this

{80}------------------------------------------------

# Managing Donor Information

type creates a transaction that appears in the donor's giving history marked as a Notification Letter. The amount does not affect the donor's giving totals.

**Matching Gift:** this type allows you to enter an amount of money to be given to supplement someone else's donation, usually made by an employer to match an employee's contribution. Choosing this type generates a pledge transaction for the matching gift record.

## To enter send notification, soft credit, or matching gift links

### To edit a gift

1. Find the donor record you want to edit, and double-click it.
2. Click the **Gift** tab. The **Initial Gift Lookup** screen appears, showing gift information in several columns across the screen.

![](_page_87_Picture_7.jpeg)

- Make the necessary changes, and then click **Done**.

## Applying a Gift to a Pledge

A pledge is a promise of a gift to be given at a later date or over a specified period of time. After you have set up a pledge, you can add existing gifts to that pledge in order to fulfill it. (See "Maintaining Pledge Information" page 91 for details on setting up pledges.)

![](_page_87_Picture_14.jpeg)

**Note:** If you are adding a new pledge payment, it is inefficient to create it as a gift and add it to the pledge. Instead, you should create it as a pledge payment, which will automatically create a gift entry and populate it with the correct information. If you created the payment as a gift first, you would have to enter all of that information by hand. See "Applying Pledge Payments" page 97 for details.

### To apply a gift to a pledge

1. Edit the gift entry (see "Editing a Gift," above).
2. Click the **Apply Payment** button in the main toolbar:

![](_page_87_Picture_20.jpeg)

A pledge is a promise of a gift to be given at a later date or over a specified period of time. DonorPerfect has the ability to monitor the pledge balance as it gets paid off, print reminder letters as the pledges become due, and track overdue pledges.

## Adding Pledges

The **Pledge Entry** screen, like all other screens in DonorPerfect, can be modified to meet the needs of each specific organization; therefore, the graphic and the field descriptions included in this section may not match the format for your organization.

When adding new pledges, default values may display in some fields when you first enter the **Pledge Entry** screen. For more information on setting up default values, see page [29](#page-28-0).

#### X **To add a pledge**

- 1. Find the donor record for which you want to add a pledge, and double-click it. The record appears.
- 2. Click the **Pledge** tab. The initial **Pledge Lookup** screen appears.

![](_page_90_Picture_10.jpeg)

# Managing Donor Information

### 3. Click the **Add** button. The **Pledge Entry** screen appears.

![](_page_91_Figure_2.jpeg)

### 4. Complete the following fields for the pledge:

- **Pledge Date:** the date the pledge was made by the donor. This field defaults to the current system date, but you can select another date. As with other date fields, right-clicking on the field or clicking the magnifying glass displays a calendar from where you can select a date. This field is commonly used to represent the date the pledge was made.
- **Start Date:** the date on which to start the billing cycle and send the first pledge reminder.

![](_page_91_Figure_7.jpeg)

- **Total:** the total pledge amount. If you're entering a **perennial pledge** (for example, \$10 a month), which means it's an ongoing pledge with no end date or total amount, enter 0.
- **Initial Payment:** the initial payment should be entered if a portion of the pledge is paid at the time the pledge is made. This prevents a negative amount from being calculated in the Delinquent Amount field, which could occur if a payment is made in the same month as the Start Date.
- **Number of Payments:** this field is optional and does not exist in all systems. It is used in the Quick Pledge Entry process. If **Number of Payments** and **Total Pledge Amount** have been entered, the **Billing Amount** is automatically calculated. For instance, if the **Total Pledge** is **\$100** and the **Number of Payments** is **5**, the **Billing Amount** will automatically fill with **\$20**. If this field

**Page 92 Version 10.0 August 2008**

{92}------------------------------------------------

- is not on your pledge screen, add it to the Gift (DPGIFT.DBF) table and Pledge Entry screen. The field name is **nb\_pmts,** and it must be a Character type. Add it to the screen, and set **Scrnvalid** to **Y**. For more details on adding fields, see "Adding Fields" in the *DonorPerfect Administrator's Guide*..
- **Billing Amount:** the amount to be invoiced for each billing cycle. If the donor has an unusual payment schedule (see Billing Cycle below), this amount will be zero.
- **Billing Cycle:** the value shown in this field determines how often the pledge is to be billed. You have the following choices: Weekly, Every Other Week, Twice Per Month, Monthly, Every Other Month, Quarterly, Semi-Annual, Annual, Unknown (don't bill), or Unusual Payment (any payment cycle other than weekly, every other week, twice per month, monthly, every other month, quarterly, semi-annual, annual, or unknown). For details on using an unusual payment schedule, see Entering an Unusual Payment Schedule, page [95](#page-94-0).
- **Send Reminder?** must be selected for pledge reminders to be generated during pledge processing. For more information on pledge reminders, see page [189](#page-188-0).
- **General Ledger:** the fund (general ledger account) that will be credited for the pledge gift. For examples of General Ledger codes, see page [46](#page-45-0).
- **Solicitation:** this field tells what solicitation or effort is responsible for generating the pledge. For examples of solicitation codes, see page [47.](#page-46-0)
- **Thank You Letter:** the number of the thank-you letter the donor should receive for this pledge.
- **Campaign:** this optional field can be automatically filled based on the entry in Solicitation or General Ledger. For instance, if there is an annual campaign code of AN08 made up of 3 different solicitations (for example, mailing, phonathon, and dinner), you can set the campaign field to automatically fill with AN08 whenever one of those solicitations is entered in a gift. For more information on how to set this up, see the discussion of the **Auto-Fill Campaign** field under **SOL (Solicitation Code)** in "Adding Codes" page [41.](#page-40-0)
- **Gift Solicitor:** The person in your organization responsible for bringing in the gift.
- **Write-off Amount:** if a portion of the total is not going to be paid, enter the amount to be written off. The pledge balance is then determined by the following calculation: (Pledge Total) – (Total of Pledge Payments) – (Write-off Amount).

{93}------------------------------------------------

- **Write-off Date:** if a portion of the total is going to be written off, the date of the write-off.
- **Thank You Address:** the address to which this thank-you letter should be sent.
- 5. When you are finished entering all information for the record, click **Done**.

If you added a pledge that had an initial payment, you'll see the following message:

**Press OK then press the Pledge Tab and Apply Payment to complete the initial payment transaction.**

Click the **Pledge** tab, and then click the **Apply Payment** button to create the initial payment for the pledge. The record is updated with the payment. For more information on applying pledge payments, see page [97](#page-96-0).

#### *Linked Pledges*

The **Link Name to Pledge** option allows you to link another donor record to the current pledge as a Soft Credit, Notification, or Matching Gift Link.

#### *Types of Pledge Links*

In DonorPerfect, there are three types of pledge links you can create:

- **Soft Credit:** use this type to recognize one donor, such as a board member or other solicitor, for the contribution of another. Choosing this type creates a transaction that appears in the giving history, marked as a Soft Credit with an asterisk. The amount does not affect the donor's giving totals unless you change how the system handles calculated fields; for more information, see "Defining Calculated Fields" in the *DonorPerfect Administrator's Guide.*
- **Send Notification:** this type allows you to generate a thank-you letter to the linked name (in addition to the donor) at Acknowledgment Processing time. For instance, a letter can be generated to the person for whom the pledge was in tribute. Choosing this type creates a transaction that appears in the donor's giving history marked as a Notification Gift. The amount does not affect the donor's giving totals.
- **Matching Pledge:** this type allows you to enter an amount of money given to supplement someone else's donation, usually made by an employer to match an employee's contribution. Choosing this type generates a pledge transaction for the matching gift record.

#### X **To enter a linked pledge**

- 1. From the **Pledge** entry screen, click **Link Name to Pledge**. The **Linked Gifts** screen appears.
- 2. Click **Add**. The **Set Type of Gift Link** screen appears.

**Total:** 0

**Billing Amount:** enter the amount to be invoiced for each billing cycle

**Billing Cycle:** enter the frequency of each billing cycle

The Balance Due will remain at 0.00, but the Delinquent Amount will update as payments are made in response to pledge reminders. Therefore, this pledge will appear to have been paid ahead of schedule, because the Delinquent field will have a negative number in it.

## <span id="page-96-0"></span><span id="page-96-0"></span>Applying Pledge Payments

The **Apply Payment** button on the **Initial Pledge Lookup** screen automatically creates a gift payment record that lowers the pledge balance. The amount defaults to the Billing Amount. Each time you receive a gift as a payment for a pledge, you need to apply a pledge payment.

{98}------------------------------------------------

- 6. When you are finished entering the payment information, click **Done**. The following pledge information is automatically updated within the Pledge record:
  - **Balance Due:** the total pledge amount minus payments and any write-off amount; updated each time a pledge gift is entered through Apply Payment. (See page [194](#page-193-0) for information about writing off a pledge).
  - **Delinquent Amount:** the total amount billed (to date) minus payments; updated each time a pledge payment gift is entered through Apply Payment, and each time reminders are run. For details on how this field is calculated, see page [191](#page-190-0).
  - **Last Paid:** this field is updated each time a payment is entered through Apply Payment.
  - **Last Date Billed:** this field is updated each time the pledge is included in pledge reminders.

If you are reviewing a pledge record after payments have been applied, you can view all payments that have been made for the pledge. To do this, click the **List Pledge Payments** button. The **List of Pledge Payments** screen appears, listing the Date, Amount, General Ledger, Solicitation, and Reference for each payment.

## Quick Pledge Entry

**Quick Pledge Entry** allows you to quickly enter a group of pledges from **existing donors** in the system. This streamlined interface allows you to perform several common pledge entry tasks from the same screen. This reduces mouse clicks and speeds date entry when you have a number of pledges to enter at the same time. (The Quick Pledge Entry screens can be customized, so yours might look different from the ones shown here.)

### To use Quick Pledge Entry

1. Click the **Quick Entry** button

# Maintaining Other Information for Donors

The **Other Information** entry screen allows you to maintain non-financial transactional information about donors. There are many possible uses for this tab such as tracking volunteer hours or names of children.

**Note:** Like all other DonorPerfect entry screens, the Other Information screen can be modified to meet your organization's individual needs. For this reason, the fields, graphics, and instructions in this section may not match the layout used by your organization. The pull-down in the upper right corner of the screen allows you to access sub-screens; some of the fields included in the graphics in this section may appear on these sub-screens.

## Adding Other Information

To capture additional information, such as volunteer hours or board terms, for your donors, use the Other Information screen.

### To add other information

1. Find the donor record for which you want to add other information.
2. Double-click the record. The record appears.
3. Click the Other Info. tab. The Initial Other Information Lookup screen appears.

# Linking Records

The **Link** screen stores an unlimited number of relational "links" between records. For instance, you can link a donor to their children or grandchildren. This option can only be used if both records to be linked have been entered in the system. Creating links between records allows you to see how your donors are related, and if you set up your link codes to have reciprocal links, you can easily navigate to the linked record when you click the Link tab. Just click the **Go to Linked Record** button, and the system opens the linked record. For information on how to set up reciprocal links, see page 110.

**Tip:** Try to make your link codes as generic as possible, so you'll be able to use them across many donors. For example, instead of setting up one code for *brother* and one for *sister*, just set up one for *sibling*.

## Adding Links

Linking records is a great way to capture relationships between different donors in your system.

### To add links

1. Find the donor record for which you want to add links, and double-click it. The record appears.
2. Click the **Link** tab. The *Initial Link Lookup* screen appears.

![](_page_107_Figure_11.jpeg)

- Click **Add**. The *Link Entry* screen appears.
- Enter the **Link Code** designating the relationship of this record to the linked record. Some examples of link codes are CH for Child, PA for Parent, EE for Employee.

{108}------------------------------------------------

- and EM for Employer. For information on how to modify the codes appearing on this list, see page 29.
- 5. In the **ID of Name to Link** field, enter the ID # of the record you are linking to if you know it. However, you will seldom know this, so you will usually have to look up the name. To do this, click the **Lookup Name to Link** button. Enter the name you are searching for, and click **Lookup** or press **ENTER**. DonorPerfect displays the names matching the one you entered. Highlight the appropriate name, and double-click it or press **Enter.** DonorPerfect automatically enters the link's ID # and name into the donor's file.

![](_page_108_Picture_4.jpeg)

6. When you are finished entering all information for the record, click **Done**.

# Editing Links

As relationships between donors change, you may need to edit and update their links.

#### X **To edit links**

1. Click the **Link** tab. The **Initial Link Lookup** screen appears, showing link information in several columns across the screen.

![](_page_108_Figure_10.jpeg)

- 2. Highlight the link you want to modify, and click the **Edit** button. The **Link Entry**  screen appears for the record you selected.
- 3. Make the necessary changes, and then click the **Done** button.

{109}------------------------------------------------

# Managing Donor Information

![](_page_109_Picture_14.jpeg)

## Deleting Links

If a relationship between donors is terminated (for example, an employee leaves an employer), you may need to delete the link that captures the relationship.

#### To delete links

1. Find the donor record for which you want to delete a link, and double-click it. The record appears.
2. Click the **Link** tab. The **Initial Link Lookup** screen appears.
3. Highlight the link you want to delete, and click the **Delete** button. The following message appears: **Are you sure you want to delete this record?**
4. Click **Yes**, and then click **Done**.

## Configuring Reciprocal Links

When a link is created from one record to another, the system automatically creates a reciprocal link from the second record back to the first. For instance, if you create an "employer" link from Roger Sandstone to the company he works for, the system will automatically create an "employee" link for that company that points back to Roger.

In order for this to work properly, however, you must specify for each type of link what the corresponding reciprocal link type will be. For instance, for Parent, you would specify that the reciprocal link should be a Child link. This is set up in the Code Maintenance screen.

#### To configure the reciprocal links for each link type

1. Select **Utilities**, then **Code Maintenance**.

![](_page_109_Picture_14.jpeg)

1. Set **Show only** to **LINK**.
2. Press the **TAB** key. The current link type codes in the system will be listed.

# **6. Working with Selection Filters**

Selection filters allow you to select a small number of records in your database that have one or more characteristics in common, and then run lists, mailings or reports using only those records.

For example, you could create a filter that selects only the donors who live in a specified city. If you had an event in that city, you could then use that filter to send out notices to only the donors that live there.

# **Overview**

 This chapter gives you an overview of how selection filters are used to create lists, reports, and exports. See the following sections for more information:

- "Basic Selection Filter Concepts"
- "Where Selection Filters Are Used"—see page [118](#page-117-0)
- "Types of Selection Filters"—see page [119](#page-118-0)
- "What to Consider When Creating a Selection Filter"—see page [119](#page-118-1)
- "Operators Available for Use with Selection Filters"—see page [124](#page-123-0)
- "Setting a Selection Filter"—see page [121](#page-120-0)

- "Managing Selection Filters"—see page [133](#page-138-0)
- "Customizing Descriptions for Selection Filter Fields"—see page [142](#page-141-0)

# <span id="page-117-0"></span><span id="page-117-0"></span>**Basic Selection Filter Concepts**

# Where Selection Filters Are Used

Selection filters allow you to identify donors in your database who have one or more characteristics in common. They allow you to work with a specific group of donors in your database instead of working with the entire database. When you want to perform a specific action for the entire database (all records in your system), you don't need to use a selection filter.

Selection filters are used with the following DonorPerfect features:

- Lookup of Donor Records (see page [50\)](#page-49-0)
- Financial Reports (see the *DonorPerfect Reports* manual)
- Donor Listings (see the *DonorPerfect Reports* manual)
- Custom Reports (see the *DonorPerfect Reports* manual)
- Exporting Reports (see the *DonorPerfect Reports* manual)

{118}------------------------------------------------

- Labels (see page [170](#page-169-0))
- Mail Merges (see page [158](#page-157-0))
- Group Email (see page [152\)](#page-151-0)
- Pledge Processing (see page [189\)](#page-188-0)
- Flexible Information Generator (see the *DonorPerfect Administrator's Guide*)
- Duplicate Maintenance (see the DonorPerfect Administrator's Guide)

# Types of Selection Filters

<span id="page-118-0"></span><span id="page-118-0"></span>Selection filters can range from simple to complex. Simple filters can search one value in one field, multiple values in one field, one or more values in different fields, and values across databases. Complex filters can contain more than one simple filter. Selection filters require the use of operators in order to compare a value to the contents of a field.

## *Simple Filters*

The following are examples of simple filters you can create in DonorPerfect:

- One value in one field: gifts of \$50.
- Multiple values in one field: gifts ranging from \$50 to \$100.
- One or more values in different fields: gifts of \$100 or more for the building fund.
- Multiple databases: gifts of \$100 or more between January 2005 to June 2005 (Main table) given by donors from Pennsylvania, New Jersey, or New York (Address table).

## *Complex Filters*

Complex filters typically have the following characteristics:

- use AND *as well as* OR within the same database
- edit the filter in the Selection Verification screen, often to insert parentheses

For more information on complex filters, see page [128](#page-127-1).

# <span id="page-118-1"></span><span id="page-118-1"></span>What to Consider When Creating a Selection Filter

All selection filters are built by specifying one or more comparison statements. To create comparison statements, you must decide each of the following:

- **Table (database):** which table the field is in, e.g., Main (DP.DBF), Address (DPADD.DBF), Gifts (DPGIFT.DBF), etc. To see a list of which fields are in which tables, see page [277.](#page-276-0)
- **Specific field:** the field in which the data is stored (for example, Record Type, Flags, GL, or AMT).
- **Comparison operator:** the operator (for example, equals, greater than, between, etc.) you need to use to find the appropriate records.

• **Comparison value:** the value you are looking for or want to compare. For example, if you're looking for records that have a flag of BD (board member), BD is the comparison value.

# <span id="page-120-0"></span><span id="page-120-0"></span>**Setting a Selection Filter**

In DonorPerfect, you have several options when running selection filters: use a previously saved filter, use the last filter you used, or build a new filter.

# Reusing the Previous Selection Filter

DonorPerfect gives you the option to use the last filter you created. This is particularly useful if your last filter was lengthy, and you need to use it again or make slight changes to it. If you use passwords, then the last filter is set per user. This allows each user to pull up the last filter they created. If you don't use passwords (single user version only), the last filter is the one used by anyone in the DonorPerfect system.

## X **To use the last filter**

- 1. From the screen where you need to create a selection filter, select the **Set Selection Filter** check box. The **Selection Criteria Screen** appears.
- 2. Click the Use Last Filter button. The Selection Verification Screen appears.
- 3. Make any necessary changes to the filter.
- 4. Click **OK**.

# Selecting a Previously Saved Selection Filter

In DonorPerfect, you can use saved filters for common selections.

#### X **To use a saved selection filter**

- 1. From the screen where you want to use a saved selection filter, select the **Set Selection Filter** check box. The **Selection Criteria Screen** appears.
- 2. Double-click on the saved filter you want to run. The **Selection Verification Screen** appears.
- 3. Click **OK**.

# Building a New Selection Filter

The process of building a new selection filter is identical for running lists, mailings, and reports.

#### X **To build a new selection filter**

1. From the screen where you need to define a selection filter, select the **Set Selection Filter** check box. The **Selection Criteria Screen** appears.

**Tip:** The comparison values are case sensitive. If necessary, use the SHIFT or CAPS LOCK key to change the case of the letters you enter.

- <span id="page-122-0"></span><span id="page-122-0"></span>7. In section , click one of the following buttons:
  - **Finished** This was the last selection statement you were adding, so you are finished and ready to go to the Selection Verification Screen (Step 9).
  - **AND** You plan to add another selection statement to the filter, using a logical statement like "if A and B are true then this record will appear in the report."
  - **OR** You want to add another selection statement to the filter, using a logical statement like "if A or B are true, then this record will appear in the report."
- 8. If you clicked the **AND** or **OR** buttons, repeat steps [3–](#page-121-0)[7.](#page-122-0)
- 9. If you chose **Finished, go to Verify Selection**, the Selection Verification screen appears:

- a. If the **Address** table was selected, a **Main Address Only** checkbox appears. Check this box to filter out any additional address records from your output.
- b. If the **Gifts** table was selected, an **Exclude Non-Gifts** checkbox appears. Check this box to filter out all soft credits, pledges, matching gifts, and notifications from your output.

![](_page_123_Figure_4.jpeg)

11.Once you have finished making changes, click the **OK** button to finish creating the selection filter. You will be returned to the screen on which you checked the **Set Selection Criteria** checkbox. The new selection filter will be enabled, and only records that match its selection criteria will be displayed.

**Note:** You can also click the **Save Filter** button to finish creating the filter and save it for reuse. See "Saving a Selection Filter" page [127](#page-126-0) for details.

## <span id="page-123-0"></span><span id="page-123-0"></span>*Operators Available for Use with Selection Filters*

DonorPerfect allows you to use many different types of operators to compare values in the system.

#### *Operators for Single-Valued Fields*

Many fields in DonorPerfect can only contain one value (for example, Gift Amount or Zip Code). The following table lists the operators you can use with single-valued fields:

| Single-Valued Field<br>Operator | Description                                                                                                                                                                                            |
|---------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| equal to (=)                    | For numeric fields, finds records where the value in the field is equal to the value<br>specified.                                                                                                     |
|                                 | For character fields, finds records that <i>begin</i> with the characters specified.                                                                                                                   |
|                                 | Example: Zip=951 finds records in which the Zip Code <i>begins</i> with 951. Accordingly,<br>it will find records with Zip Codes of 95111, 95112, 95167, and so on but not 95211,<br>95951, and so on. |
| not equal (#)                   | For numeric fields, finds records where the value in the field is not equal to the<br>value specified.                                                                                                 |
|                                 | For character fields, finds records excluding those records that begin with the<br>character specified.                                                                                                |

| less than or equal to (<=)      | For numeric fields, finds values less than OR equal to the values specified.<br>For character fields, finds records where the character string is alphabetically less<br>than OR equal to the characters specified.<br>For date fields, finds records where the date is less than OR equal to the value<br>specified.                                                                                                   |
| greater than (>)                | For numeric fields, finds values greater than but NOT including the values<br>specified.<br>For character fields, finds records where the character string is alphabetically<br>greater than but NOT including the characters specified.<br>For date fields, finds records where the date is more recent than the value specified.                                                                                      |
| greater than or equal to (>=)   | For numeric fields, finds values greater than OR equal to the values specified.<br>For character fields, finds records where the character string is alphabetically<br>greater than OR equal to the characters specified.<br>For date fields, finds records where the date is greater than OR equal to the value<br>specified.                                                                                          |
| between (BT)                    | When selected, you enter a range of values for the search, and the filter selects<br>records whose value is within the range, including the values specified.<br>Example: GTOT BT 100-500 finds all donors whose giving grand total (GTOT) falls<br>between \$100 and \$500 (inclusive). This operator is also helpful when selecting<br>between a range of dates.                                                      |
| in list of options (IN)         | This operator saves you from a lengthy OR statement such as ST=CA OR ST=AZ<br>OR ST=NV. Use this if the field you are searching only contains one value.<br>Example: St IN CA,AZ,NV finds all records with the states of California, Arizona, or<br>Nevada.<br>The Find Opposite check box appears when using the M\$ and IN operators.<br>Checking this box finds all records that do NOT have the requested criteria. |
| exactly equal to (==)           | For character fields, finds records where ALL the characters in a field are equal to<br>the value you enter; this is different than the equal sign, which compares just the<br>beginning of the field.<br>Example: ZIP==95111 finds records that have exactly 95111 as their Zip Code.<br>Those with 10-digit Zip Codes that begin with 95111 (such as 95111-0022) will not<br>be selected.                             |
| month equal to (MO)             | Finds dates that fall in the specified month.<br>Example: BDAT MO 9 finds all records with a value in the Birthdate (BDAT) field in                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |

#### *Operators for Multi-Valued Fields*

Some DonorPerfect fields allow you to enter multiple values in a single field (for examples, FLAGS or NARR). The following table lists the operators you can use with multi-valued fields:

| Multi-Valued Field<br>Operator | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
|--------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| contains (\$)                  | Finds records where one criteria appears anywhere in the field.<br><br>Example 1: Flags \$ "BD" - finds all records where "BD" (board member) is<br>within FLAGS field, regardless of where it appears in the field.<br><br>Example 2: Narr \$ "bequest" - finds all records where the word "bequest"<br>appears anywhere within the narrative field. |
| does not contain (N\$)         | Selects records that do NOT contain the criteria you enter.<br><br>Example: Flags N\$ "BD" - finds all records that do not have "BD" in FLAGS<br>field.                                                                                                                                                                                               |

### Multi-Valued Field Operator

| Operator                | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
|-------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| multiple contains (M\$) | This operator saves the user from a lengthy OR statement such as<br>Flags\$"BD" or Flags\$"AM" or Flags\$"GT". Use this instead of the IN (In List of Options) when the field can contain more than one value.<br>Example: Flags M\$ "BD","AM","GT" finds all records with Flags of BD, AM, or GT.<br>The Find Opposite check box appears when using the M\$ and IN operators. Checking this box finds all records that do NOT have the requested criteria. |

## Saving a Selection Filter

Any set of selection criteria can be given a name and saved.

### To save a selection filter

1. On the Selection Verification Screen, click the **Save Filter** button. The following message appears:

![](_page_126_Picture_7.jpeg)

1. Click **Yes**. An expanded version of the Selection Verification screen opens:

![](_page_126_Figure_9.jpeg)

{127}------------------------------------------------

# Working with Selection Filters

DonorPerfect

1. In the **Filter Name** field, enter a name for this filter. If the filter name already exists, a warning message appears, and you will have to use a different name.
2. If you want to share the filter with other DonorPerfect users, select the **Shared** check box. If you use passwords and you don't share the filter, you'll be the only user who can access this filter. When you access the shared filter via the Selection Criteria Screen, you'll see which user created the filter and on what date.
3. Select the **Filter Group** you want to save the filter in. Click the **Edit Filter Groups** button to edit filter groups. (For details on editing filter groups, see "Editing Filter Groups" page.)
4. If you want to restrict the use of this filter to certain user groups, enter the group number in the **User Group** field. For more information on groups, see "Managing User Groups" in the *DonorPerfect Administrator's Guide*. The user group restricts display and use of the filter to users who are in a particular group.
5. In the **Description** field, enter a lengthier description that will appear when the saved filter is highlighted. This description is optional, but recommended.

![](_page_127_Figure_7.jpeg)

**Note:** The selection statement and related fields appear beneath the **Description** field, but it should not be necessary to edit them.

1. Click **OK**.

## Clearing the Current Selection Filter

To stop using a selection filter that has been set for a screen, uncheck the **Set Selection Filter** checkbox. The filter will be disabled, and all available records will now display in the output from that screen.

## Advanced Uses of Selection Filters

See the following sections for details on the advanced uses of selection filters:

- Combining ANDs and ORs in a selection filter
- Running Two-Pass selection filters

## Combining ANDs and ORs in a Selection Statement

If you are trying to find records that have multiple characteristics, you can use ANDs and ORs in your selection filters. Depending on how you set up your statement, the records may meet all the criteria you include or only certain portions of the criteria. Here are three examples of AND/OR selection statements:

- Donor either lives in Pennsylvania OR gave over \$100
- Donor has a grand total greater than \$100 AND lives in Pennsylvania
- Donor lives in Pennsylvania OR Maryland AND gave more than \$100

Page 128

Version 10.0 August 2008

{128}------------------------------------------------

Keep the following in mind when using ANDs and ORs in selection filters:

- If **AND** is selected, then all selection statements connected by an operator must be true for the record to match.
- If **OR** is selected, then any one of the selection statements connected by an operator must be true for the record to match. Using OR will result in more matching records.

To remember the difference between using ANDs and ORs, remember that a person looking for a car that is "practical or economical or sporty" will have a much easier time finding a car than someone who is looking for a car that is "practical and economical and sporty"!

If you have both ANDs and ORs in your selection filter, you'll need to use parentheses in order to make sure the system executes the filter in the correct order. You place these on the **Selection Verification Screen**. As you can see in the following examples, the placement of the parentheses significantly changes the search outcome:

| Sample Filter                                              | Filter Description                                                                                                    | Explanation                                                                                                                                                                          |

# Running Two-Pass Selection Filters

You can use two-pass selection filters to find or exclude records that match a complex set of criteria. To use two-pass selection filters, you'll need to use the Tag Date. Using the Tag Date in a selection filter consists of two parts:

- **First-pass:** create a selection filter that selects a group of records that meet a certain set of criteria; then, mark the selected records with the Tag Date you've chosen.
- **Second-pass:** create another filter that excludes or includes a group of records based on the Tag Date that you set.

{129}------------------------------------------------

# Working with Selection Filters

The following situation is an example of when you would use a two-pass selection filter: you need to select donors who have given 2 different types of gifts: BANQ (Banquet) and MM01 (Membership Mailing 1). To find these records, you must first create a selection filter that finds donors who gave a BANQ gift and update the Tag Date for those records. Then, you must create a second selection filter that finds records that match the Tag Date you just updated and have given a MM01 gift. If you tried selecting gifts with a Solicitation of BANQ OR MM01, you would get anyone with either gift, but not necessarily both. If you selected BANQ AND MM01, you would get a message that "No Records were found...." Since each gift has only one solicitation code, no gift could have both BANQ AND MM01. This example is illustrated in the instructions below.

## To run a two-pass selection filter

1. From the Listings and Mailings screen, select the **Update Tag Date** check box.
2. In the date field next to **Update Tag Date**, enter a Tag Date with which you want to update the records you will select from your database. The field defaults to today's date; you can leave that date or enter another date. Just make sure the date is unique, so that no other records in the system have that value. Be sure that you don't use a Tag Date that you've previously used. If you do, it's possible that records you don't want will be selected as part of your filter; this will make your results inaccurate.
3. If you are updating a date field that you have added to your DP table, enter the field name in the **Tag Field** box. If you are using the Tag Date field that comes with your system, leave the default value of TAG\_DT in the field.

# **Sample Selection Filters**

This section includes some sample selection filters that you can use to become more familiar with the concepts discussed in this chapter. Each table included in this section lists the following information for each sample selection filter:

- an explanation of which records the selection filter will find
- actual selection filter
- the table, field, operator, and comparison used in the selection filter

## *Simple Selection Filters*

The following table shows some simple selection filters.

## *Using A Mathematical Equation As Part of Comparison Value*

Occasionally, a mathematical equation is used as part of the comparison in a selection filter. For example, the printout is to be comprised of donors who gave 25% more this year than last year.

There are four mathematical equations available as part of the comparison portion of the selection filter. They are: \* (multiplication); + (addition); - (subtraction); and / (division). These statements can only be entered in the **Selection Verification** screen.

The following are examples of selection statements using mathematical comparisons.

## **Customizing Descriptions for Selection Filter Fields**

You can customize the field descriptions that appear on the DP Selection Screen, where you set up selection filters. For details, see "Defining Field Name Descriptions" in the "Defining Parameters" chapter of the *DonorPerfect Administrator's Guide*.

A second pop-up screen appears: Version 10.0 August 2008 --- OCR End ---You are an expert at extracting text from documents and arranging it into clear, structured HTML that humans enjoy reading. You have a colleague who is struggling to properly extract text from an image and format it. You'll be given an image, the initial extracted html, and the formatting instructions from a user who will be reading the document. The initial extracted HTML may have errors, and may be poorly formatted. You will need to reformat it according to the user's instructions, and also fix any errors in the HTML. Guidelines: - The initial extracted html will need significant improvement - it is often missing content, has formatting issues, and is not structured well. - All of the important content should be extracted from the image - don't leave anything out. - The content should be organized in a logical way, with headings, paragraphs, lists, tables, and other html elements as appropriate. - The content should be laid out in a way that a human can easily read and understand it. - Ensure reading order is logical and intuitive for a human reader. - Only use tables when the content is actually tabular data - don't use tables for layout. - Images and associated text will be placed into the html like . They will be surrounded by tags, along with any text within the figure. If the image is better handled as text (like a logo, icon, table, etc), omit the image tag and just include the html representation or detailed description of the image. Otherwise, make sure to include the placeholder image tag and the src attribute in the appropriate place in the html. You don't need to include the div tag, just the img tag. - Preserve a tags and hrefs if possible. - Make sure the final HTML is readable, visually appealing, and presented well. - Text must exactly match what is in the image - don't change any words or numbers. Formatting should be in HTML, with the following rules: - for italics, for bold, and for inline code. - Use for superscripts. - Use for subscripts. - Headers should be formatted with , with for the largest header, and up to for the smallest. - Lists should be formatted with for unordered lists and for ordered lists, with for list items. - Links should be formatted with text. - Use for code blocks. - Inline math should be formatted with math expression. Display math should be formatted with math expression. All math should be in LaTeX format. - Values and labels should be extracted from forms. Don't omit any content in the forms, but make them visually appealing. Show checkboxes as and radio buttons as . - Tables should be formatted with the tags , , , , and . - Only use the tags , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,

{149}------------------------------------------------

# **Running Group Emails**

A group email allows you to send emails to a group of donors instead of printing letters to send.

![](_page_149_Picture_4.jpeg)

**Warning!** Your email server must operate as an open relay in order to send out group emails through it from DonorPerfect. Since running as an open relay is often seen as a security risk, you should check with your IT staff to see if this is possible before continuing.

> If it is not possible for your email server to operate as an open relay, you will need to send emails using some other method. It is possible to send out email using the mail merge feature in Microsoft Office, for instance.

By default, Group emails are sent to any phone entry that contains an **@**. See page [55](#page-54-0) for how to enter email addresses in the phone number field. It is recommended that you use a selection statement to limit the emails to only those donors you absolutely want to send email to.

When you run group emails, it is recommended that you choose one of the "Update Last Contact" options (see ["Mailing Options](#page-167-0)" on page [168](#page-167-0) for more information). Because each email is sent separately, this helps you track to which donors the email was sent. This is especially useful if a group email is disrupted before it is completed; in this situation, you can filter out the names that have already received the email.

# Setting Up Group Emails

In order to send group emails, you'll need to set up both password protection and define group email settings. These settings are set up separately for each DonorPerfect user, in the Email/WP tab of the User Security Settings screen (see "Managing Security" in the *DonorPerfect Administrator's Guide* for full details on this screen).

### X **To set up group emails for a user**

- 1. From the main screen, click the **Utilities** button, select **Change Parameters**, and then click **User Security Settings**.
- 2. Select the user account you want to set up group emails for, and click the **Edit**  button.
- 3. Select the **Email/WP** tab of the User Security Settings screen.

# **Mail Merge**

# Overview

DonorPerfect gives you the ability to create communications for your donors through the use of mail merge data files. You have the ability to produce thank-you letters, pledge reminder letters, emails, and other types of communication you need.

# *Uses of Mail Merge Data Files*

You can use mail merge data files in many different ways. Here's a list of some of the communications you can produce through mail merge data files:

- personalized thank-you letters
- solicitations
- pledge reminders
- labels
- envelopes
- group emails

You can also use mail merge data files to take DonorPerfect data into another program for further analysis and manipulation. DonorPerfect's mail merge data files have certain fields included by default. See the following section for more information on each type of DonorPerfect mail merge file.

# *Types of Mail Merge Files*

DonorPerfect allows you to create several different types of mail merge files, which you can use to communicate with your donors. The type of communication you are sending determines what type of mail merge file you need to create. DonorPerfect can create four types of mail merge files:

| Mail Merge File       | Where Accessed in System             | Uses                                                                               |
|-----------------------|--------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Regular Mail Merge    | Mailings, Mailmerge                  | To produce any type of letter for<br>donors with information from<br>DonorPerfect. |
| Thank-you Letter File | Reports, Acknowledgment Processing   | To produce thank-you letters for gifts<br>that donors gave to your organization.   |
| Pledge Reminder File  | Mailings, Pledge Processing          | To produce reminder letters for donors<br>who owe you a payment on a pledge.       |
| Insta-Merge           | File, Add/Edit Records, Printer Icon | To produce a letter for a single donor<br>in your system.                          |

**Page 156 Version 10.0 August 2008**  

{156}------------------------------------------------

# Producing Communications & Mail Merges

Each mail merge file starts with the same 13 fields, but depending on the file, other fields may be available. You also have the option to add fields to each mail merge file (for more information, see page 158). The following fields are available in each mail merge file:

| 1. donor id | 5. title       | 9. city   | 13. ptitle |
|-------------|----------------|-----------|------------|

Version 10.0 August 2008 OFTEN USED IN THE CONTEXT OF DATA ANALYSIS AND MACHINE LEARNING. IT IS A TECHNIQUE USED TO REDUCE THE COMPLEXITY OF A MODEL BY REMOVING UNNECESSARY FEATURES OR VARIABLES. THIS CAN HELP TO IMPROVE THE MODEL'S PERFORMANCE, GENERALIZATION ABILITY, AND INTERPRETABILITY. THE GOAL OF FEATURE SELECTION IS TO IDENTIFY THE MOST RELEVANT AND INFORMATIVE FEATURES THAT CONTRIBUTE THE MOST TO THE PREDICTIVE POWER OF THE MODEL. BY SELECTING ONLY THESE FEATURES, THE MODEL CAN BE SIMPLIFIED, REDUCING THE RISK OF OVERFITTING AND IMPROVING ITS ABILITY TO GENERALIZE TO NEW, UNSEEN DATA. THERE ARE SEVERAL METHODS FOR FEATURE SELECTION, INCLUDING STATISTICAL TECHNIQUES, MACHINE LEARNING ALGORITHMS, AND DOMAIN EXPERTISE. THE CHOICE OF METHOD DEPENDS ON THE SPECIFIC PROBLEM, THE NATURE OF THE DATA, AND THE DESIRED OUTCOMES. FEATURE SELECTION IS AN IMPORTANT STEP IN THE MODELING PROCESS, AS IT CAN SIGNIFICANTLY IMPACT THE MODEL'S ACCURACY, EFFICIENCY, AND UNDERSTANDABILITY. BY CAREFULLY SELECTING THE MOST RELEVANT FEATURES, THE MODEL CAN BE MADE MORE ROBUST, INTERPRETABLE, AND CAPABLE OF MAKING ACCURATE PREDICTIONS ON NEW DATA.

{157}------------------------------------------------

### *Fields in Pledge Reminder File*

The Pledge Reminder File is called DONPLG.CSV or DONPLG.DBF, depending on the mail merge delimiter you've defined (see the *DonorPerfect Administrator's Guide*). The following fields are automatically included in the file:

| 1. donor id   | 7. second line | 13. ptitle         | 19. frequency   |
|---------------|----------------|--------------------|-----------------|
| 2. lname      | 8. address     | 14. bill amount    | 20. delinq. amt |
| 3. suff       | 9. city        | 15. total amount   | 21. current due |
| 4. fname      | 10. state      | 16. balance due    |                 |
| 5. title      | 11. zip        | 17. general ledger |                 |
| 6. salutation | 12. phone      | 18. solicitation   |                 |

**Note:** See page [158](#page-158-1) for directions on setting up additional fields to be used in your mail merge. See page [160](#page-159-0) for information about printing mail merges for your type of word processor.

# Editing the Fields in Mail Merge Files

You can edit the specific fields which appear in a mail merge data file. For details, see "Edit Mail Merge Fields" under "Defining Parameters" in the *DonorPerfect Administrator's Guide*.

# Setting Up DonorPerfect to Work with Your Word Processor

DonorPerfect's default settings are compatible with Microsoft Word. No setup is required, unless you are using another word processor or want to change the default settings. If you are using passwords in DonorPerfect, see page [38](#page-37-0) for details. If you aren't using passwords, see "Setting Parameters for Mailings" in the *DonorPerfect Administrator's Guide*. After you've set up DonorPerfect to work with your word processor, see page [160](#page-159-0) for instructions on how to run mail merges.

# Creating a Single Mail Merge Letter with Insta-Merge

 While in a donor's record, you can merge his or her name and address information into a single mail merge letter. This is a great way to run a mail merge for a single name or for a handful of names that aren't tied together by particular criteria. If you are on the Gift screen and there are gift fields in the merge data file format, it will include data from the current gift.

### X **To create a single mail merge letter with Insta-Merge**

1. From the donor record for which you want to create a mail merge letter, click the **Printer** icon . The **Single Printouts** dialog box appears.

![](_page_159_Picture_6.jpeg)

- 2. Select **Merge a Letter**.
- 3. To print the letter, click the **Print** button. To preview the letter, click the **Preview** button. The **Open** dialog box appears.
- 4. Click the mail merge document you want to use for the letter. In your DonorPerfect folder, you can find a document called **SINGLE.DOC**. Use this as a template for the mail merge document for Insta-Merge.
- 5. Click the **Open** button. The file opens in Word, and you are asked if you want to save changes.
- 6. Click **Cancel**, and then make any changes to the letter. The data file for a single mail merge is made up of the same field names as the Regular Mail Merge File (for details on which fields are included, see page [157\)](#page-156-0).

# Running Mail Merges with DonorPerfect Merge Files

<span id="page-159-0"></span><span id="page-159-0"></span>Once you've created the appropriate mail merge file in DonorPerfect, you need to use your word processor to create the mail merge letters you'll send to your donors. This section outlines some things to consider when using mail merge files with a word processor as well as instructions on creating mail merge letters in both Microsoft Word and WordPerfect.

# *Using DonorPerfect Mail Merge Fields with Your Word Processor*

The instructions included in this section detail the specific steps you should take to use mail merge files in your word processor; however, the following list outlines some points you should keep in mind when you use certain mail merge fields in your word processor.

• **Company/Organization Names.** If the Last Name field contains a company or organization name, and the record is set to be an organizational type of record, the contact person's name will automatically display in the *first name* merge field and the organization's name will display in the *second line* merge field.

**Page 160 Version 10.0 August 2008** 

{160}------------------------------------------------

# Producing Communications & Mail Merges

## Title Field

**Title Field.** The title field (the field that holds Mr./Ms.) automatically has a space after it. Therefore, do not place a space in your form letters between the *title* and *fname* fields. That way, if someone does not have a title (for instance, John and Martha Smith), a space will not print at merge time.

## Salutation Field

**Salutation Field.** If the salutation field is left blank, it defaults to the Title+Lname as long as there is something in the title field. If there is nothing in the title field, it defaults to the first name field.

## Current Due in Pledge Mailmerge

**Current Due in Pledge Mailmerge.** The *current due* field in the Pledge Mail Merge File is the current amount due. If the pledge is due in the current month, this is the Bill amount or the pledge balance, whichever is less. If the pledge is not due this month (for example, it is an annual pledge to be billed every January and the current billing period is March), but it is being placed in the pledge reminder file because there is a delinquent amount, the current due is 0. To use the current amount due in a formula, the name of the memory variable is *mcurr*. Therefore, the formula *mcurr+dpgift.deling* would show the current amount due plus the delinquent amount.

## Running Mail Merges in Microsoft Word 97, 2000, 2002, and XP

This section includes instructions on running mail merges in several different versions of Microsoft Word: 97, 2000, 2002, and XP. In order to run the mail merges, you'll need to create mail merge letters and then perform the actual mail merge in the version of Word you're running.

## Creating Mail Merge Letters

Before you can actually use the mail merge data files you created in DonorPerfect, you need to create the mail merge letters you want to send to donors in Word.

To help you create the letters, the DonorPerfect system includes the following sample Microsoft Word letter, called WPTHANKS.DOC, which you can use as a basis for your mail merge letters. When you are creating a mail merge letter, we recommend always using this sample as a template, and copying it by clicking the File menu in Word and then choosing Save As.

### Sample Mail Merge Letter:

```
{{TITLE}}{{FNAME}} {{LNAME}}
{{SECLN}}
{{ADD}}
{{CITY}}, {{ST}} {{ZIP}}

Dear {{SAL}},

Thanks for your donation of ${{AMT}}.
```

In addition to the WPTHANKS.DOC sample letter, DonorPerfect includes several other samples. The following table lists the names of all the sample letters as well as which DonorPerfect mail merge data files they should be used with. If you're using FoxPro data files with Word, the name of the FoxPro data file that the letter should be used with is included in the FoxPro File column.

Version 10.0

{161}------------------------------------------------

| Sample Letter File                   | Mail Merge File | FoxPro File |
|--------------------------------------|-----------------|-------------|
| WPTHANKS.DOC (Thank-you Letter)      | TY.CSV *        | TY.DBF      |
| WPLETTER.DOC (All-Purpose<br>Letter) | DONMRG.CSV *    | DONMRG.DBF  |
| WPPLEDGE.DOC (Pledge Letter)         | DONPLG.CSV *    | DONPLG.DBF  |

**<sup>\*</sup>**If you started using DonorPerfect before version 9, your mail merge files may have a DTA extension instead of a CSV extension. You can continue running your DTA files as usual; you do not have to switch to the CSV format.

### X **To set up your letters**

1. First, create a list of letter numbers and types of letters. For example:

| Letter # | Type of Letter   |
|----------|------------------|
| 01       | Under \$50 gift  |
| 02       | Over \$50 gift   |
| 03       | Memorial         |
| 04       | Capital Campaign |

- 2. Create these letters by copying your original WPTHANKS letter. It is suggested that you name the files THANKS1, THANKS2, and so on, or use another convention that has the number in the name of the file. Remember to customize each thank-you letter for your donor audience.
- 3. As you enter each gift through the Gift entry screen, enter the number of the letter you want to use in the **Thank-you #** field. For example, enter 01 for gifts that will be sent thank-you letter 1, 02 for thank-you letter 2, and so on. When the system produces the thank-you letter files, the gifts that have 01 as the thank-you letter will be included in the TY01.CSV file, the gifts that have 02 as the thank-you letter will be included in the TY02.CSV file, and so on.
- 4. When you acknowledge gifts, be sure to create the thank-you merge file. See page [158](#page-157-0) for more information.

When the mail merge files are created, you should use the thank-you file you created that corresponds to the appropriate DonorPerfect mail merge file. The following table shows how they might correspond:

| Thank-You Letter File | Mail Merge File | FoxPro File |
|-----------------------|-----------------|-------------|
| THANKS1.DOC           | TY01.CSV        | TY01.DBF    |
| THANKS2.DOC           | TY02.CSV        | TY02.DBF    |
| THANKS3.DOC           | TY03.CSV        | TY03.DBF    |

5. If you want to print envelopes or labels to all people who are to get thank-you letters, use the TY.CSV file. This file holds all names of people from all the TY?.CSV files.

| Update Tag Date | A Tag Date is a date that you temporarily assign to a group of people in your database.<br>The Tag Date is used as the first part of a two-pass selection filter. You can use a Tag<br>Date in two situations: when you want to exclude or include a group of donors from a<br>filter. In situations where the filter is too complex or you need to use both AND and OR<br>among three or more files, use a two-pass selection filter with a Tag Date.                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
|                 | Note: See page 129 for detailed procedural information on running two-pass selection<br>filters.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| Tag Field       | If you select the Update Tag Date check box, all records included in the procedure will<br>have their "Tag Date" revised to reflect the date entered in the Tag field. The default tag<br>date field is tag_dt, but you may change it to any date field that you have added from<br>the Main (DP.DBF) table. In a multi-user environment, this will allow users to set up their<br>own Tag Dates without overwriting what another user is doing. To do this, you must first<br>add a date field to the structure of the Main (DP.DBF) table (see "Customizing Screens<br>& Tables" in the DonorPerfect Administrator's Guide).                                 |

# **8. Processing Gifts & Pledges**

# **Overview**

After you enter the gifts and pledges that your organization has received from donors, you need to review and process them in your system. Typically, you'll acknowledge gifts and process pledges on a regular basis that fits in with the needs and requirements of your organization.

This chapter leads you through how to acknowledge gifts and process pledges in the following sections:

- ["Acknowledging Gifts"](#page-170-0) on page [171](#page-170-0)
- ["Creating Pledge Reminders](#page-188-0)" on page [189](#page-188-0)

# <span id="page-170-0"></span><span id="page-170-0"></span>**Acknowledging Gifts**

- ["Reviewing Gift Entries](#page-170-1)" on page [171](#page-170-1) tells you how to review the gifts that have been entered into the system to make sure they are correct. You should review gift entries every time you want to print thank-you letters.
- ["Creating Thank-You Letters"](#page-177-0) on page [178](#page-177-0) explains how to create thank-you letters from within DonorPerfect, without first opening your word processor. You can create thank-you letters anytime, but it's a good idea to review your gift entries for accuracy first.
- ["Version 8 Options"](#page-181-0) on page [182](#page-181-0) describes methods for acknowledging gifts that were used in version 8 of DonorPerfect. Prior to DonorPerfect version 9, these were the only methods available. (Acknowledgment Processing was called "Batch Processing" in the earlier versions). These methods are being included for users who are familiar with them, and would like to continue using them until they have a chance to try the newer methods.

Before you create thank-you letters, you should to review your current batch of gifts.

![](_page_186_Figure_8.jpeg)

8. From the **File** menu, click **File Close**. Your changes to the batch are saved.

# *Updating the Batch*

When you are finished processing a batch, you should update it. This assigns a unique number to the batch and marks it as processed, ensuring that the gifts in the batch are not accidentally processed again.

![](_page_186_Figure_12.jpeg)

**Important!**

**Important!** If you don't update the batch after creating a thank-you merge file, the gift entries will be reprocessed the next time you perform Acknowledgment Processing, and you could accidentally send duplicate thank-you letters.

- X **To update the gift batch** 
  - 1. Click the **Acknowledgments** button . The **Acknowledgment Processing** screen appears (**Error! Reference source not found.** on page **Error! Bookmark not defined.**).
  - 2. Click **Version 8 Options.** A second **Acknowledgment Processing** screen appears (**Error! Reference source not found.** on page **Error! Bookmark not defined.**).
  - 3. Click **Batch Update**. The following System Message appears:

This will update the batch record counter for all gifts in the current batch. You should run a batch listing and create thank-you files before running this procedure. Continue?

{187}------------------------------------------------

4. Click **Yes** to proceed with the batch update.

{188}------------------------------------------------

# **Creating Pledge Reminders**

To process, you need to set pledge parameters, run monthly pledge reminders, and review pledge reports.

![](_page_188_Picture_4.jpeg)

Important

**Important!** Close any open merge documents before you create pledge reminders, or you may encounter errors.

![](_page_188_Picture_7.jpeg)

**Note:**

**Note:** SofterWare offers a Pre-Authorized Payments/EZ-EFT Module to process payments; see page [272](#page-273-0) for more information.

# Setting Pledge Parameters

DonorPerfect allows you to set parameters for how you will handle pledges in your system. You can set the parameters to define whether or not to do the following:

- Include pledges in financial reports
- Delete old pledge balances
- Allow negative pledge balances
- Show pledges on the History List

For detailed instructions on how to set up pledge parameters, see the section on "Setting Pledge Parameters" in the *DonorPerfect Administrator's Guide*.

# Running Monthly Pledge Reminders

Pledges should be processed on a monthly basis. DonorPerfect automatically designates the current billing cycle as the month following the date of the last billing. A billing is defined as when pledge reminders are created and the "Include Current Dues?" check box has been selected. For example, if the last billing was run for May, DonorPerfect will automatically designate June as the current billing cycle. However, this period can be easily adjusted through pledge parameters or at run time. For more information, see "Setting Pledge Parameters" in the *DonorPerfect Administrator's Guide*.

**Important!**

**Important! DELINQUENT AMOUNTS MUST BE UPDATED ONCE A MONTH.** The Bill amount of each pledge is added to its Delinquent field each time pledge reminders are run. This is offset by subtracting the amount of any payment as it is applied. Thus, the Delinquent field reflects the amount that has been billed but not received. "Early Payers" are those with a negative delinquent amount. For more information about delinquent amounts, see the following sections.

- 8. To send reminders to donors who have already paid for the month, select the **Include early payers** check box.
- 9. From the **Mailmerge** pull-down, choose the type of output you want. You can choose **Mailmerge**, **Report**, **Invoice**, or **Labels**. If an option other than Mailmerge is chosen, the **Do** button changes to **Print/Preview**. If you select labels, you can choose from a label type using the default label pull-down.

- 10.If you're running a mail merge, click the **Do** button. If you're running invoices, reports, or labels, click either the **Preview** or **Print** button. A message indicating the number and total dollar amount billed appears. For mail merges, it also tells you what the name of the file will be and that the file will overwrite any previous file of the same name.
- 11.Click **OK.** Then to exit, click **Cancel**. You are ready to print the pledge reminders. See page [160](#page-159-0) for directions on running mail merges for your word processor.

# How Balances and Delinquent Amounts are Updated

When pledge reminders are generated, the system updates the Pledge tab for each pledge with the following information:

- **Delinquent Amount:** reflects the amount billed in the reminder process, minus any payments.
- **Balance Due:** reflects the outstanding amount due for the pledge.

Each time a pledge payment is made, both the Balance Due and Delinquent Amount decrease accordingly. If a donor makes a payment during a period for which pledge reminders have not been run, the Delinquent Amount will be a negative number. This is accurate, because they have pre-paid and should be credited that amount. Do not manually adjust the Balance Due or Delinquent Amount because they are automatically calculated.

Each time pledge reminders are run and the "Update Delinquent Amounts" check box is selected, the Delinquent Amount is recalculated based on the billing date. The following is an example of how the delinquent and balance due amounts are calculated:

Total Pledge **400.00** 

{191}------------------------------------------------

Amount to Bill **100.00** 

Start Date **06/01/2007** 

Frequency **Quarterly** 

In this example, the donor will be billed four times at \$100 a quarter, with the first pledge reminder sent out in June 2007. The **Balance Due** and **Delinquent Amount** will be calculated as follows:

| Pledge Transactions        | Balance<br>Due | Delinquent<br>Amount |
|----------------------------|----------------|----------------------|
| Pledge entered in system   | 400.00         | 0.00                 |
| Pledge reminder sent 6/07  | 400.00         | 100.00               |
| Payment made 7/07          | 300.00         | 0.00                 |
| Pledge reminder sent 9/07  | 300.00         | 100.00               |
| Payment made 9/07          | 200.00         | 0.00                 |
| Early payment 11/07        | 100.00         | -100.00              |
| Pledge reminder sent 12/07 | 100.00         | 0.00                 |
| Payment made 12/07         | 0.00           | 0.00                 |

# Setting an Auto-Reminder to Run Pledge Reminders

You can set DonorPerfect to prompt you to run pledge reminders on a specific day of the month. If you have not yet run reminders for the current month, starting on the day specified, the following message appears when you log into the system:

The pledge reminders are due. Run Mailings, Pledge Reminders.

#### X **To set auto-reminder for pledge reminders**

1. From the main screen, click the **Utilities** button and select **Change Parameters,**  then click **Pledge Parameters**. The Pledge Parameters screen appears.

# Pledge Parameters

![](_page_192_Figure_2.jpeg)

1. Select any of the following options, if appropriate:

- **Include Pledges in Financial Report?:** when selected, includes non-pledge payments, plus pledge totals, in financial reports. If this check box is **not** selected, all gifts, including pledge payments, are included in financial reports, but pledges aren't included. Pledge dates are based on the date the pledge was made. If you select this option, you must also include a filter for all calculated fields. For more information, see "Defining Calculated Fields" in the *DonorPerfect Administrator's Guide*.
- **Allow Neg Plg Balances?:** when selected, the pledge balance is negative if a donor overpays. If this check box is **not** selected, pledge balances are never less than zero. A negative balance accurately reflects that the pledge has been overpaid, but reports that sum the Balance field for a number of pledges will be inaccurate.
- **Show Pledges on History List?:** when selected, pledges appear on the History Listing in addition to gifts. If this check box is **not** selected, pledges do not appear on the History List.

2. In the **Show prompt on x day of month to run reminders** check box, enter the day of the month you want to be reminded on.
3. Click **OK**.
If you selected the **Include Pledges in Financial Report?** check box, the following message appears:

{193}------------------------------------------------

# Writing Off Pledge Balances

In addition to having the option to enter a write-off amount for a specific pledge (see page 93), DonorPerfect gives you the option to write off the balances for a selected group of pledges. For instance, you may choose to write off all pledges for a campaign that ended over a year ago. When this option is run, the write-off amount for the desired group of pledges becomes filled in with the current balance due, which writes off the remainder of the pledge and makes the balance 0.

**Warning!** It is highly advised that you back up your data before writing off pledge balances.

### To write off pledge balances

1. From the main screen, click the **Utilities** button and select **Recalculate** and **Write off Pledge Balances**. The **Write Off Pledge Balances** dialog box appears.

![](_page_193_Picture_8.jpeg)

- Check the **Set Selection Filter** check box to define a selection filter. Define the filter, and click **OK** at the Selection Verification Screen. For more information on setting up selection filters, see page 118.
- Click the **Do** button. A message appears telling you all delinquent amounts and balances will be recalculated.
- Click **OK**. A message appears telling you the delinquent amounts and balances were recalculated.

Suggested Action: Set Selection Filter/Preview Constituents

Back
Next
DoneOnce you have added a new event to the system, your next step is to send out invitations to your constituents. You do this by generating a data file in the **Invitations** tab of the Add/Edit Event screen. You can then use this data file to do a mail merge when you send out the invitation mailing.

The general steps in generating the data file for invitations are:

1. Decide whether to invite "No Mail" constituents or not.
2. Set a selection filter to screen out unwanted constituents
3. Preview constituents
4. Select the constituents to invite
5. Create contact records
6. Export the data file

## Including "No Mail" Constituents in Invitations

Check **Include "NO MAIL" Names** to send invitations to donors whose records are marked **NO Mail**.

## Setting a Selection Filter to Screen Out Unwanted Constituents

By default, the Invitations tab will display every donor in your DonorPerfect system. This can be inefficient, particularly for an event that will draw from a relatively small geographic area.

Version 10.0  
August 2008  
Page 203

{203}------------------------------------------------

# Using the Event Management Module

## DonorPerfect

The solution is to set up a selection filter that screens out the unwanted donors. For instance, you can set up a filter that selects only those donors who are located in the same city and state as the event.

To begin setting up a selection filter, check the **Set Selection Filter** checkbox. For details on using selection filters, see "Working with Selection Filters" page 118.

### Previewing Constituents

Once you have set up a selection filter (or decided not to), click the **Preview Constituents** button to see a listing of all the constituents in the system that match your selection filter criteria.

# Managing Sponsored Events

Sponsored Events are events like walk-a-thons, dance-a-thons, or bowl-a-thons, in which donors sponsor one or more players. The donors pledge to contribute some amount of money for each unit of activity (mile walked, hour danced, home run scored, etc.).

The total contribution will be the pledge per unit of activity, multiplied by the number of units completed by the players.

In order to manage a sponsored event through DonorPerfect, some setup is required.

# Setting Up DonorPerfect to Manage Sponsored Events

In order to manage a sponsored event in DonorPerfect, you must first add the **PLAYER** and **PLGPER** fields to the Pledge Entry screen to allow you to specify the player associated with the pledge, and the pledge per unit of activity completed.

## Computing Pledge Totals using the Update Sponsored Pledges Button

Once you have entered player codes and pledges for the sponsored event, and updated the player codes with the number of work units completed, you need to calculate the final pledge totals for all of the event's pledges.

This is done using the Update Sponsored Pledges button that can be found in the **Report Options** area of the Sponsored Event reports.

The total amount for a pledge is simply the number of work units completed multiplied by the pledge per unit.

### To compute the totals for sponsored event pledges using the Update Sponsored Pledges button

1. In the Event Management Module, click on the **Event Reports** link. The Event Reports screen opens.
2. Under Report Category, select **Sponsored Events**.
3. Under Select Report Type, select either **Constituent Report** or **Participant Report**.
    **Note:** You can select either report, the **Update Sponsored Pledges** button is on both report screens, and functions identically in either location.
4. Click the **Update Sponsored Pledges** button. A confirmation message appears:
    [Screenshot of System Message]
5. Click the **OK** button to update the pledge totals. Once the update finishes, a second message appears:

#### *Running the Sponsored Event Reports*

Two reports are provided to enable you to monitor sponsored events:

- **Constituent Report** This report shows how much each sponsor pledged to each participant in a sponsored event.
- **Participant Report** This report shows how much each participant raised in donations for sponsored events.

For details on running these reports, see "Monitoring Event Status Using Event Reports" page [242.](#page-241-0)

#### *Sending Out Pledge Reminders for Sponsored Events*

Once you have updated the **# Played** fields for each player in the sponsored event, and have computed the pledge totals for your event's pledges, you are ready to send out pledge reminders to the sponsors.

Once pledge totals have been computed, sending out pledge reminders for a sponsored event works just like any other pledge reminder.

DonorPerfect has been able to support fundraising auctions for some time, but with the advent of the Event Management module, things have become a bit better organized.

The basic idea is that auction items are entered into the system as In-Kind gifts. Each item in the auction is also assigned an Item Number. The winning bids are also entered as gifts, referencing the same Item Numbers. The system can then generate reports that track item donations and winning bids.

The general work flow for supporting an auction in DonorPerfect 10 is as follows:

- 1. Add the auction as an event in the Event Management module.
- 2. Enter the items that are up for auction.
- 3. Print out bid sheets for each item before the event.
- 4. At the auction, record the bids for each item on the bid sheets.
- 5. After the event, enter the winning bids into the system.
- 6. Generate reports and mailings for the auction.

# Adding the Auction as an Event

Before you enter auction items for an event, you must create the entry for the event itself.

The minimum that you need to do for an auction is to create the event itself: you do not need to fill out all the details with guest invitations and the like unless you want to.

For details on adding an event, see "Adding a New Event" on page [196.](#page-195-0)

# Recording the Winning Bids for Auction Events

At the auction event, use the Bid Sheet reports that you printed out before the event to keep a record of the bidding for each item in the auction.

Once the auction is over, use the bid sheets to enter the winning bids into your system.

# Entering the Winning Bids for Auction Events

## Generating Reports and Mailings for Auction Events

#### *Auction Reports*

DonorPerfect provides the following reports to aid you in managing your auctions:

- **Bid Sheets** Print these out before the event to aid in recording the bids for each item. See ""Bid Sheets" page [253](#page-252-0) for details.
- **Item Report** This report lists each item entered for selected events. See "Item Report" page [251](#page-253-0) for details.
- **Purchaser Report** This report lists the donors who made the winning bids for each item in the selected auctions. See "Purchaser Report" page [255](#page-254-0) for details.

## *Generating Mailings for Auctions*

In general, when outputting data files for mailings related to auctions, you will be outputting lists of gifts associated with the solicitation code for the auction.

You will want to use a selection filter to separate the gift records for auction item donations from the gift records for the winning bids.

For details on creating selection filters, see "Working with Selection Filters" page [118.](#page-117-0)

### *Creating a Selection Filter for Auction Item Donation Records*

The purpose of this report is to show customers how long it takes donors to respond to invitations. In terms of parameters, customers should have the option to select one or many events to compare. No start date or range is required since the system should simply be comparing the invitation date to the response date, calculating the range that the constituent fits in, and then grouping the results by event code.

The Auction Bid Sheet report is an older version of the Bid Sheets report.

It is included for the convenience of existing users who take advantage of its unique features. It can still be used with auctions entered through the Event Management module, as well as with existing auctions.

The Auction Bid Sheet (used for silent auctions) prints one item per page, with a grid below for the donors to enter their name, phone #, and price. This report assumes that the entire description of each auction item has been entered in the GNARR field.

**Note:** To run the Auction Report by Purchaser with auctions created before the existence of the Event Management module, the purchased item must be tied to the description and value of the item. You can do this one of two ways:

- **Use Item #:** assign each item a number (gift field ITEMNUM), and enter the number in both the item donor's gift and purchaser's gifts. In this case, you only need to enter the value and description of the item in the donor's record and not the purchaser's record.
- **Enter Value of Item in Purchaser's Record:** if you do not use the item number, you need to enter the value and description of the item in both the donor's record and the purchaser's record.

#### *Event Setup*

The Event Setup screen is not a report at all, though it can be found among the Special Event reports. It doesn't produce any kind of on-screen or printed output.

# Using Additional DonorPerfect Modules

DonorPerfect

## EZ-EFT Module/Pre-Authorized Payments

Would you like to reduce your fund-raising costs, increase the lifetime value of your donors, while making it as easy as possible for your donors to give on a regular basis? It may seem too good to be true, but by creating a successful pre-authorized gift program, you really can achieve all these benefits for your organization. Many DonorPerfect clients have done so, including one that is processing thousands of pre-authorized donations each month, averaging \$30,000-\$40,000 in gifts.

DonorPerfect users can collect one-time or on-going donations by direct electronic transfer with our EZ-EFT (Electronic Funds Transfer) Direct Giving module. This unique module allows your donors to pre-authorize the automatic payment of pledges by their bank or credit cards. DonorPerfect stores the needed account information and creates, posts, and transmits donations electronically to your account. The transfers appear on your donor's bank or credit card statements. This approach allows nonprofits of any size to take advantage of the same technology used by large corporations.

### Benefits

The Pre-Authorized Payments/EZ-EFT Module gives you the following benefits:

- **Less Administrative Time and Cost:** EZ-EFT will automatically collect and record gifts, and adjust pledge balances, saving posting time and cost. By eliminating the high cost pledge collection, you'll net more funds for your organization.
- **Automatic Fulfillment and Reliable Cash Flow:** Once donors sign-up for Direct Giving, pledge collection is automatic. This means all pledges are paid, and your cash flow will be improved and predictable. Instead of spending your valuable time sending pledge reminders, send your donor a letter of appreciation!
- **Encourages Larger Gifts and Annual Renewals:** By allowing donors to spread their contributions over the year, it is easier to generate larger pledges. And once a donor makes an EZ-EFT Direct Gift, you can count on increased annual renewals and giving levels.
- **Enhanced Convenience for Donors:** EZ-EFT is simple for your donors. They won't have to remember to write checks or renew their pledges, making their busy lives easier.
- **Better Security and Control of Funds:** No more worrying about lost checks, mishandled funds, or deposits not being made in a timely fashion.
